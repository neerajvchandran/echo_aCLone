##Environment Variables (Backend)

Create a `.env` file inside your backend folder:

```
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key

SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
FROM_EMAIL=your_verified_sender_email
```

---

##Running the Project

###Backend

```
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Backend runs at:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

### Frontend

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at:
```
http://localhost:5173
```

## Authentication Flow

### Signup Flow
1. User registers
2. OTP is sent to email
3. User verifies OTP
4. JWT token is generated
5. User redirected to Feed

### Login Flow
1. Email + Password
2. JWT issued
3. Token stored in localStorage

---

## Feed Logic

- Feed displays posts only from users you follow
- Like button toggles like/unlike
- Users can edit or delete only their own posts

---

## Security

- Passwords hashed using bcrypt
- JWT expires after 7 days
- OTP expires in 5 minutes
- Protected routes secured with `requireAuth` middleware

---

## Future Improvements

- Comments system
- Image uploads
- Notifications
- Improved UI styling
- Dark mode
- Pagination
- Real-time updates (Socket.io)
